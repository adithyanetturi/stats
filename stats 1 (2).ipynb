    "# Measures of dispersion, including range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to quantify the spread or variability within a dataset. Here's how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a quick assessment of the spread of the data by considering the full extent between the highest and lowest values. For example, if the range of test scores in a class is 50, it indicates a wider spread compared to a range of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variance: The variance is a more precise measure of dispersion, calculated by averaging the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It takes into account the deviation of each value from the mean and provides a measure of the average spread. For example, a large variance in income data indicates a greater variability in individual incomes within a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a more interpretable measure of dispersion in the same units as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates a greater spread or variability of data points around the mean. For instance, a larger standard deviation in exam scores implies a wider range of performance among students.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Coefficient of Variation: The coefficient of variation is a relative measure of dispersion, calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean and expressed as a percentage. It allows for the comparison of variability between datasets with different means. A higher coefficient of variation indicates greater relative variability. For example, comparing the coefficient of variation in rainfall between two regions helps understand which region experiences more relative variability in precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is a robust measure of dispersion that considers the spread of the middle 50% of the data. It is calculated as the difference between the upper quartile (75th percentile) and the lower quartile (25th percentile). The IQR is less sensitive to extreme values or outliers and provides insights into the central range of the dataset. For instance, a large IQR in housing prices indicates a wide variation in prices within the middle range of the market."
