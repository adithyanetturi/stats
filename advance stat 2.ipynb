    "# Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "# The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a countable set of distinct values. It gives the probability of each possible value that the random variable can take. The PMF is defined as:\n",
    "# PMF(x) = P(X = x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# where X is the random variable and x is a specific value that X can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of rolling the die, and it can take on values from 1 to 6. The PMF of X would be:\n",

    "# PMF(1) = 1/6\n",

    "# Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "# The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a range or interval. Instead of giving the probability of individual values, the PDF gives the probability density at each point in the range of the random variable. The probability of an event occurring within a specific interval is given by integrating the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "# The PDF is denoted by f(x) and satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "# f(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n",
    "# The total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1.\n",
    "# For example, consider a continuous random variable X representing the height of individuals in a population. The PDF of X might follow a normal distribution. The PDF would provide the probability density at each possible height value. However, to determine the probability of finding an individual with a height between a specific range, we would need to integrate the PDF over that range."

    "# The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is widely used as a model in various fields when certain assumptions are met. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Natural Phenomena: Many natural phenomena tend to follow a normal distribution. For instance, the heights of individuals in a population, IQ scores, errors in measurements, and the distribution of weights of manufactured items can often be well approximated by a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Financial Markets: In finance, the normal distribution is often used to model stock returns and other financial variables. It assumes that the changes in prices or returns follow a normal distribution, which is a common assumption in many financial models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quality Control: In manufacturing processes, the normal distribution is used to model the variability of measurements or defects. It helps in setting quality control limits and determining the acceptability of products within specified tolerance levels.\n",

    "# Biometric Measurements: Various biometric measurements, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body temperature, are often assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption simplifies analysis and allows for the calculation of probabilities and confidence intervals.\n",

    "# Psychometric Testing: Many psychometric tests, such as intelligence tests or personality inventories, assume a normal distribution of scores. This assumption helps in interpreting individual scores and comparing them to a standardized population.\n",

    "# Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the distribution. It determines the width of the bell curve. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower curve, indicating less variability around the mean. Conversely, a larger standard deviation leads to a wider curve, representing greater variability."
